Crawl a web page
----------------

The most simple way to use our program is with no arguments.
Simply run::

        crawler <url>

to crawl a webpage.

Crawl a page slowly
-------------------

To add a delay to your crawler,
use :option:`-d`::

        crawler -d 10 <url>

This will wait 10 seconds between page fetches.

Crawl only your blog
--------------------

You will want to use the :option:`-i` flag,
which while ignore URLs matching the passed regex::

        crawler -i "^blog/" <url>

This will only crawl pages that contain your blog URL.


        Only crawl certain pages
        ------------------------

        You will want to use the :option:`-i` flag,
        which while ignore URLs matching the passed regex::

                crawler -i "pdf$" <url>

        This will ignore URLs that end in PDF.
